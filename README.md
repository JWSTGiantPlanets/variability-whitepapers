# Variability Whitepapers: Outer Planet Systems and Other Solar System Topics
Whitepapers due 8 Sept. 2023
* [STScI info webpage](https://outerspace.stsci.edu/display/HPR/Long-term+variability+monitoring+strategies+for+HST+and+JWST)
* [STScI survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfFCd4vY4QP0mOkACwScC-CHawrUPBDIXr8PGbOeAWZvsrlPQ/viewform)
* [LPSC abstract template](https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/templates/abstract_templates.shtml) (but any format is fine)

Collection of white papers planned for submission to the Working Group: Long-term variability monitoring strategies for HST and JWST. Add your whitepaper to this repository if you want to share thoughts, request comments, or request cosigners. 
The number/identity of cosigners on any individual whitepaper probably does not strongly affect its impact, but it helps people documennt their participation/interest. We hope that by coordinating our efforts, we will reduce duplication that the Working Group will have to deal with.

### Format
Whitepapers are supposed to be one page, but at the Town Hall, Working Group co-chair Saurabh Jha said "one page plus figures and references." Here is a suggested format:
* Page 1: Title, lead author, text.
* Page 2+: References, Figures, Co-signers and co-authors.
